# Hi, I'm Anish

## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a Data Engineer with 5+ years of experience building and maintaining data pipelines, designing data architectures, and enabling analytics at scale.  

- Strong in **Python, SQL, and Apache Airflow** for pipeline orchestration  
- Experienced across **AWS, Azure, GCP, and Heroku** for cloud-based data solutions  
- Skilled in **data lakes, lakehouses, and warehouses** with tools like S3, Redshift, Glue, and Athena  
- Well-versed in **containerization and orchestration** using Docker and Kubernetes (AWS EKS)  
- Background in **Agile/Scrum, TDD, and version control** with Git & Atlassian tools  
- Worked on **cross-team machine learning projects**, architecting data workflows to support intelligent systems  

## 💡 What I’m Interested In  
- Scalable and automated data workflows  
- Modern lakehouse technologies  
- Cloud-native data platforms and infrastructure as code (Terraform)  
- Collaboration between data engineering and ML teams

## 🔄 One of the many data flow I have designed
📥 Raw Data → ⚙️ Airflow + Python → 💾 Data Lake (S3) → 🛠️ DBT + SQL → ❄️ Redshift → 📊 Analytics 🚀  

## 🎯 Outside of Work  
- Love exploring stealth games (big Ghost of Tsushima fan 🥷) 
- Into road trips & travel ✈️  
- Always up for geeking out about data, tech, or strategy games
